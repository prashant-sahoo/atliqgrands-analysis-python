# AtliQ Grands Hospitality – Adhoc Data Analysis (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the [Codebasics Resume Challenge](https://codebasics.io/challenges/codebasics-resume-project-challenge/7).  
It focuses on performing **adhoc data analysis** for AtliQ Grands, a hospitality hotel chain, using the **Python Pandas library**.  
The objective was to answer business questions quickly and efficiently, showcasing how Python can be leveraged for flexible, scalable analysis compared to SQL.  
In addition to Pandas, I also used **basic graphs from the Matplotlib library** to visualize key findings and make insights more intuitive for stakeholders.

## 🎯 Purpose
While SQL is excellent for structured queries, I chose **Python (Pandas + Matplotlib)** for this project to:
- Handle adhoc analysis requests with agility.  
- Perform complex data manipulations and aggregations with fewer lines of code.  
- Visualize trends and KPIs using simple Matplotlib charts.  
- Strengthen my Python data analysis skills and demonstrate versatility beyond SQL.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas Library  
- Matplotlib (basic graphs)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- VS Code 

---

## 🛠 Approach
- **Data Loading**: Imported raw datasets into Pandas DataFrames.  
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Cleaned and transformed data to ensure consistency.  
- **Adhoc Queries**: Used Pandas functions (`groupby`, `merge`, `pivot_table`, `value_counts`) to answer business questions.  
- **Visualization**: Created basic graphs with Matplotlib (bar charts, line plots) to highlight revenue trends, occupancy rates, and cancellations.  
- **Business Mapping**: Connected technical outputs to KPIs like revenue contribution, occupancy rates, and booking trends.  
- **Documentation**: Captured queries, outputs, and insights for stakeholder readability.

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Revenue Trends**: Identified top-performing cities and hotels contributing most to revenue.  
- **Occupancy Insights**: Found seasonal fluctuations in occupancy rates, highlighting opportunities for targeted promotions.  
- **Customer Segments**: Corporate bookings contributed significantly to revenue, but leisure travelers showed higher growth potential.  
- **Operational Efficiency**: Certain properties had higher cancellation rates, impacting profitability.

## 🧠 Learnings
- Strengthened skills in **Pandas for adhoc analysis**, including advanced indexing and aggregation.  
- Learned how to translate **business questions into Python queries** quickly.  
- Gained confidence in using Python for **flexible, exploratory analysis** beyond SQL’s structured environment.  
- Improved ability to connect technical outputs to **business KPIs and storytelling**.  
- Enhanced workflow efficiency by using **VS Code** for debugging, modular scripting, and notebook integration.  
- Practiced **Matplotlib basics** to visualize trends and make insights more accessible.
